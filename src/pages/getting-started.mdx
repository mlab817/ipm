# Getting Started with the IPMS

This section of the manual aims to inform the user on how to access the IPM System. The content is organized as follows:

[[TOC]]

## Accessing the System

To access the IPM System, open any web browser ([Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) is recommended) and type 'da-ipms2020.web.app' in the address bar. Press the Enter key after typing the link. You should see the following welcome screen. (actual image may differ as the app gets updated.)

At the top-right, there are two buttons to help you navigate: `Getting Started` and `Login`. Clicking on `Getting Started` will take you to the system's documentation and tutorial/help. `Login`, on the other hand, will take you to the login page.
