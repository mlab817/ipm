## Summary

The summary shows information on the number of owned projects, active notifications, and messages. 

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Note**: Messages is currently not implemented so this is currently a placeholder.

</InlineNotification>

## Shortcuts

The shortcuts contain links to various parts of the application that are deemed most useful. 

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Note:** In the future, the shortcuts may be made into a dynamic list and editable in the Settings Page.

</InlineNotification>

## Activity Feed

The activity shows the most recent activities of the user. The user can use this to track if there are actions made by their account but is not sure if they did it.

<InlineNotification kind="info">

The dashboard is a work-in-progress in that snapshot reports should also be provided to the users as well as System-wide announcements.
