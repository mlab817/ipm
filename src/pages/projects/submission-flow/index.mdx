## Submission Flow & Processing Status

The figure below describes the submission flow in the IPMS.

1. The `Encoder` encodes a project in the system via [Add Project](/projects/add) module. This gets automatically tagged as `draft`.
2. The `Encoder` then checks if the project information is complete and updates the project information via the [Update Project](/projects/update) module. The `Encoder` must update the project until all required information has been provided.
3. Once the project information is complete, they will download and print the `Project Profile` and show it to the `Head of Agency`. It is recommended to do this in a single batch or batches. The `Head of Agency` reviews the project profile and does the following:
	1. If the project profile is okay, he/she will sign the Project Profile.
	1. If the project profile is not okay, he/she will return it to the `Encoder` for further revision in the System. The `Encoder` will then re-print it.
4. Once the project profile has been signed, the `Encoder` will scan the signed copy and proceed with the [Finalization](/projects/finalize). Click `Finalize Project`. Afterwards, click `Upload Signed Copy`.
5. All finalized projects are due for endorsement. Only endorsed projects are deemed submitted. The `Encoder` can do this via the [Endorse Project](/projects/endorse) module. Click on the link for instructions on how to do this.
6. Once projects are endorsed, the `Encoder` may wait for feedback on the review of the project.
7. Endorsed projects are validated by the assigned `Reviewer` (IPD staff). This is with respect to the consistency and completeness of data and inclusion in the endorsement letter.
	1. If found consistent and complete, the `Reviewer` marks the project `validated` and proceed to review.
	1. If there are problems with the project, it is `returned` to the encoder for compliance.

As projects are processed in the system, their status gets updated. This page aims to explain the meaning of project `processing status` vis-a-vis `submission flow`.

|  # | Processing Status |                                                                   Explanation                                                          |
|----|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 |Draft              |Draft status is the lowest processing status. This is assigned to newly created projects and will stay so until it is finalized. At this stage, the encoder can `still` update the project.|
|  2 |Finalized          |Projects are `finalized` by finalizing it in the update project page. To finalize a project, the user must have  completed the required information. Finalized projects can no longer be edited.|
|  3 |Endorsed           |Once projects are finalized, they can be endorsed by the head of the operating unit to the IPD for review. Only endorsed projects can be and will be reviewed by IPD.|
|  4 |Returned           |Once endorsed, the assigned IPD reviewer is expected to validate the project by checking the completeness of information provided and if it was duly endorsed by the head of agency. A status `returned` is assigned if any of the two fails.|
|  5 |Validated          |If the two conditions of completeness and endorsement are met, the project will be marked as `validated`.|
|  6 |Reviewed           |Once a project is validated, the IPD reviewer can review the project using the `Review Project` form. Once the review is completed, this will be forwarded to the lead IPD staff for acceptance.|
|  7 |Accepted           |Accepted serves as a validation stage within the IPD. This means that the lead IPD staff accepted the project and the review made by the reviewer.|
|  8 |Approved           |Once the project is accepted, the IPD will present the list of validated projects and their review to the DA management. The DA management then decides to approve/disapprove the project/s.|
|  9 |Encoded            |Once the project has been approved, the IPD reviewer will encode this in the PIPOL System. Once encoded the project will be marked `encoded`.|

The processing status is designed to be sequential. However, depending on actual evaluations made, this could vary across projects.
