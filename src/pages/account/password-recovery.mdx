## Recovering Forgotten Password

<InlineNotification kind="warning">
Note that there is no other way to recover your password since this is encrypted in the database. Instead, you will need to reset your password through the link sent to your email. This is why having a verified email is very important. The password reset link is valid for 60 minutes.
